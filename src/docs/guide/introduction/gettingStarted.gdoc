To get started, first fork and clone the Git repository. Ensure that youare running *Grails 2.4.4*. 

The development and testing environments use the built-in H2 database, but the production environment requires a MySQL database. Details about the database name, and the required name and password of the user with full permissions to this database can be found in @Datasource.groovy@.

The application also requires API credentials to be provided as environment parameters or passed-in as command line parameters. If both the environment parameter and the command line parameter are specified, the environment parameter will take precedence. For a full list of api credentials required to be passed-in in this manner, consult the @textup.apiKeys@ block in @Config.groovy@.
