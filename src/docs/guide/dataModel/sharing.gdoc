@StaffPhone@s have the additional capability of sharing @Contact@s from the @Staff@ member that owns this @StaffPhone@ to other @Staff@ members on the same @Team@. @SharedContact@ is a wrapper class that wraps a @Contact@ and allows or prohibits operations involving this contact if this @Contact@ is no longer shared. Methods that operate on @Contact@s actually are defined in terms of a @Contactable@ interface that is implemented by both @Contact@ and @SharedContact@. In this way, both @Contact@s and their wrappers can handled without having to maintain two sets of congruent methods.
