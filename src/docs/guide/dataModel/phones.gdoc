Both @Staff@ members and @Team@s within an organization are allowed to own @Phone@s. The @Phone@ is an object that manages all @Contact@s, @ContactTag@s, texting and calling, and @Record@ keeping. In the base @Phone@ class, only @Contact@s keep a record of ongoing communications between the contact person and the owner of the phone. In short, the @Phone@ abstraction is intended to emulate how phones are used in real life. The user of the phone does not need to know about how the phone works, just how to manage information stored in the phone and communicate using interfaces provided by the phone. 

We primarily use two subclasses of the @Phone@ class: @StaffPhone@ and @TeamPhone@. The @StaffPhone@ adds the capability to share contacts with other @Staff@ members on the same team. The @TeamPhone@ adds the capability for @ContactTag@s to also keep track of outgoing communications sent through to @Contact@s belonging to each @ContactTag@.
