Similar to @Organization@s, @Staff@ members also have statuses that dictate the level of access and breadth of allowed activities. The possible statuses are:
* *PENDING* @Staff@ member who sign up and choose to be affiliated with an existing @Organization@ are given this status pending approval by an existing administrator at that @Organization@. Until the @Staff@ member is approved, only changing some informational attributes (such as email address) of the @Staff@ account is permitted; all other access is prohibitied.
* *BLOCKED* If an administrator decides that the pending @Staff@ member is not a valid staff member of this agency, then the @Staff@ might be marked as blocked. This is similar to the *REJECTED* status for @Organization@s.
* *STAFF* If an @Organization@ administrator approves the *PENDING* @Staff@ member, then the @Staff@ is immediately promoted to having *STAFF* status. Having this status allows normal capabilities such as sharing, calling, texting, or being in team, but limits this @Staff@'s ability to manage other @Staff@ members or to see the communications of other @Staff@ members beyond what is allowed by sharing.
* *ADMIN* The highest level of authority in an @Organization@. In addition to having all of the privileges conferred by the *STAFF* status, the *ADMIN* status also allows access to the admin dashboard, where approvals of pending @Staff@ members takes place.
