The process of receiving calls is again similar to that of @RecordText@s. There are several more possible events for incoming calls than incoming texts, because we need to implement dial-in voice interfaces to allow clients to hear announcements in @Team@s and to subscribe to voice call notifications. The two classes that provide additional support for are @StaffCallService@ and @TeamCallService@. All building of Twiml XML responses in the form required by Twilio occurs in the @TwimlBuilder.groovy@ class. 

One notable feature of @StaffPhone@s is that, when a @Staff@ member calls from personal phone to TextUp phone, we provide a touch-tone interface that allows the @Staff@ member to either specify a contact id or a phone number to connect to. If the contact id is valid or if the phone number is valid, we connect the @Staff@ member directly without having to force the @Staff@ member to initiate the call via the web interface.
