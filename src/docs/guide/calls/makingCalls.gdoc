Making calls happens in a similar way to how text messages are sent out. When a request comes into the @RecordController@ endpoint, the creation of a new @RecordCall@ begins a bridge call between the @Staff@ member's personal phone (with number masked by the TextUp phone number) and the desired @Contact@ to connect with. This bridge call is initiated when we first call the @Staff@ member's personal phone. Upon pickup, the @Staff@ must select any key to confirm the bridge call. After this call is confirmed, we attempt to complete the bridge call by sequentially dialing each of the specified @Contact@'s phone numbers. If all of the provided @ContactNumber@s are exhausted we inform the @Staff@ member on the phone that we have tried all possible numbers and hang up.

As before, the @Phone@ handles the details of verifying the permissions and for initiating this bridge call with the help of helper methods specified in @CallService@.
