From over-200 interviews with staff, directors, and clients of social service agencies, we know that lack of information leads to frustration, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to help people help themselves leave homelessness. Yet in metropolitan areas across the US, 50 to 70% of people who are homeless have working mobile phones. Up to 90% of those phones have unlimited texting. 

TextUp is a text messaging service that increases staff-client engagement and tracks effectiveness of communication with clients, among staff, and with other social service providers. We leverage high cell phone prevalence to empower shelters, soup kitchens, and case management agencies to (1) send alerts to all interested subscribers, (2) use a virtual work phone to communicate safely and directly with clients, and (3) schedule and automatically remind clients about appointments via text. 

In this guide, we aim to summarize the principal implementation details to get a new developer up to speed with the backend and frontend codebases that comprise this project. The TextUp backend provides the data abstractions, enforces authentication and permission requirements, and handles texts and calls for the TextUp frontend application. The TextUp frontend wraps the REST API exposed by the backend in a GUI for users.
