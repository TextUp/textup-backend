The @RecordController@ exposes the REST API interface for adding a @RecordItem@ of any specific type to a @Record@. When adding a @RecordText@, the API requires that the request specify phone numbers, contact ids, or tag ids of intended recipients. Further pre-processing of the request happens in the @RecordService@ but it is in the @Phone@ (whether @StaffPhone@ or @TeamPhone@) where the reconciling of duplicates and the sending happens. Helper methods for the sending of text messages through the @Phone@ can be found in the @TextService@ class, which handles retry logic and exception handling.
